Updating a server installation
==================

* In order to update Galleon feature-pack we can benefit of our automatic upgrade based on channel.
* By re-provisioning a server, we will get the latest artifacts (both feature-packs and module artifacts.) 
* No more product-universe. All EAP feature-packs must have their producer changed to groupId:artifactId
* Must update the pom.xml and channel.yaml with your versions of rebuilt XP, EAP and eap-datasources-galleon-pack.
* Update pom.xml to reference your channel.yaml (local to the example directory).
* POSTGRESQL_DRIVER_VERSION=42.3.1 mvn clean package -Pinstall
* POSTGRESQL_DRIVER_VERSION=42.3.1 mvn package -Pupdate

==> Server will get updated to latest versions contained in the channel.
